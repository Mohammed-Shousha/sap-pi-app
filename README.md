# SAP (Smart Automatic Pharmacy) PI App ðŸ’Š

A tablet application developed using Flutter that allows users to interact with a machine controlled by a Raspberry Pi for receiving prescriptions and ordering over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. The app provides a seamless experience for users to easily manage their medication needs.

## Features

### Receive Prescription

Users can simply press a button to scan a prescription QR code. The app utilizes the device's camera to scan the QR code and initiate the process of retrieving the prescribed medicines from the machine.

Upon successful retrieval of the medicines, the app will display a "Thank You" screen to confirm that the process has been completed. In case of any errors or issues during the retrieval process, the app will display a "Contact Us" screen, allowing the user to reach out to the support team for assistance.

### Order Medicines

Users can browse through a list of available over-the-counter medicines and select the items they wish to purchase. The app provides a convenient checkout process where users can review their selected medicines and proceed to payment.

For payment, the app supports credit card transactions. Users can securely enter their credit card details and complete the payment process. Upon successful payment, the app will initiate the retrieval of the ordered medicines from the machine.

Similar to the prescription retrieval feature, if the medicine retrieval is successful, the app will display a "Thank You" screen. If any errors occur during the retrieval process, the user will be directed to a "Contact Us" screen for further assistance.
